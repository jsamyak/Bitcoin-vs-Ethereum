               form of money/currency. In simple terms, it only has an electronic form. Like regular money, it 
               may be bought,traded, or accepted as payment, but it can also be mined. Cryptocurrency is mined 
               in a process in which transactions for the currency are verified, then added to the blockchain, 
               a constantly-growing database that exists on multiple computers at the same time. We seek to 
               investigate the 2 biggest cryptocurrencies (together they comprise over two thirds of market 
               share in June 2019): Bitcoin and Ethereum. We believe examining the most popular currencies 
               would allow us to spot trends of cryptocurrency in general. Currency usage in human civilization 
               has shifted from barter trading, to universal monetary standards such as the dollar, to recent 
               usage of cryptocurrency in many markets. Therefore, it could be interesting to examine what many

      more popular, and that we may see even more investment in the near future. Our datasets for Bitcoin
